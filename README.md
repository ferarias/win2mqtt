# Windows to MQTT

A Windows service that exposes system sensors to MQTT so that they can be consumed from IOT applications such as Home Assistant

## Roadmap

See [Roadmap](./docs/Roadmap.md).

## Architecture

[![Architecture](./docs/architecture-2022-12-13-0943.svg)](./docs/architecture-2022-12-13-0943.excalidraw)

The application is a Windows Service that runs in the background, collects system information, and 
publishes it to an MQTT broker. 

It uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with the broker and publish sensor data.

## Installation

Install as a **Windows Service**

First, build a a self-containing exe:

```powershell
dotnet publish .\src\Win2Mqtt.Service\ --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained  --output c:\Win2MQTT
```

Then create and start the service (you will need Administration privileges):

```powershell
sc.exe create "Win2MQTT Service" binpath= "c:\Win2MQTT\Win2Mqtt.Service.exe"
sc.exe start "Win2MQTT Service"
```

## Sensors

Sensors are published to Home Assistant, provided it has the MQTT integration enabled.

The default topic is `win2mqtt/{hostname}` where `{hostname}` is the name of the computer running the service.
The hostname is automatically detected and used as the prefix for all topics.

See [Sensors](./docs/Sensors.md) to see the list of available sensors and their topics.

## Listeners

Win2MQTT subscribes to several topics and, when receiving messages, executes a command or action.

See [Listeners](./docs/Listeners.md) to see the list of available listeners and their topics.
